; Command & Conquer RULES.INI
; If placed in game directory, it will not override built in values. Values to be used as
; multipliers or percentages can be specified as either a simple floating point number (embed ".")
; or as a conventional percentage number (append "%"). Values used as cell distances or time delays
; are specified as simple floating point number. Distance values are expressed in cells. Time
; values are expressed in minutes.

; This is not the real file because there is none - the C&C rules were hard-coded into the game.dat
; file (C&C95.exe in Win95 Edition). This is what the file could have been like, based on what
; editors/testing tells us, as well as what the values were in Red Alert, which is VERY similar to
; C&C. Therefore most of the rules file has been taken directly from Red Alert, as well as the rules
; flags, if applicable. The unit names are the actual names also used in the game files for the .shp
; images. There is still a lot missing from what should be here. These are usually things that cannot
; be found, so it is unknown what their values are.
; C&C is different from Red Alert and its successors in a few ways. First of all, the Burst= flag is
; not tied to weapons here. Instead, units that have this flag set to yes will fire their weapons twice,
; but another unit with the same weapon may not. Another difference is that explosions from weapons are
; attached to the weapon, not the warhead. An example is that the chemical sprayer and the high-velocity
; chaingun both use the HE warhead, which is also used for the MLRS and hand grenade. When I was doing
; testing it was hard to say this is true, but one clue was that the percentages (verses=) were the same.
; Another clue was that both weapons can destroy walls.
; Note how the object speed is drastically higher than what Red Alert uses. To make it even more
; complicated, C&C treats the speeds for different types of unit differently. But to make it a bit easier
; to compare it to Red Alert: aircraft, ship and vehicle speeds should be divided by four, while infantry
; speeds should be divided by two. Projectile speeds are ok the way they are. A strange quirk is the
; speed of the cargo plane [C17], which is 5. I have the feeling that it should be either doubled or
; tripled but I'm not certain of this.
; Another thing to note is that the numeric data hard-coded in the C&C files has building
; hit-points that are only half of what it says here, and this is also what editors show.
; Don't be fooled by this - the game is wired to double the Strength= values for buildings -
; whatever is in this file is correct.

; Animates = Does it animate [this means smoke puffs] (def=no)?
; Arcing = Does it have a ballistic trajectory (def=no)?
; Arm = arming delay (def=0)
; Dropping = Does it fall from a starting height (def=no)?
; Frames = number of image frames for animation purposes (def=1)
; Gigundo = Is the projectile larger than normal (def=no)?

; Image = image to use during flight
; Inaccurate = Is it inherently inaccurate (def=no)?

; ******* Warhead Characteristics *******
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = damage spread factor [larger means greater spread] (def=1)
;          [A value of 1 means the damage is halved every pixel distant from center point.
;          a value of 2 means damage is halved every 2 pixels, etc.]
; Wall = Does this warhead damage concrete walls (def=no)?
; Wood = Does this warhead damage wood walls (def=no)?
; Tiberium = Does this warhead destroy tiberium (def=no)?
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of full damage)...
;           -vs- none, wood (buildings), light armor, heavy armor, concrete
; InfDeath = which infantry death animation to use (def=0)
;             0=instant die, 1=twirl die, 2=explodes, 3=flying death, 4=burn death

; ******* Mission Control *******
; This specifies the various general behavior characteristics of
; the missions that objects can be assigned. Each of the game objects must
; be in a mission. The mission behavior is generally hard coded into
; the program, but there are some behavior characteristics that can
; be overridden. Don't modify these.

; NoThreat = Is its weapons disabled and thus ignored as a potential target until fired upon (def=no)?
; Zombie = Is forced to sit there like a zombie and never recovers (def=no)?
; Recruitable = Can it be recruited into a team or base defense (def=yes)?
; Paralyzed = Is the object frozen in place but can still fire and function (def=no)?
; Retaliate = Is allowed to retaliate while on this mission (def=yes)?
; Scatter = Is allowed to scatter from threats (def=yes)?
; Rate = delay between normal processing (larger = faster game, less responsiveness)
; AARate = anti-aircraft delay rate (if not specifed it uses regular rate).

; Unit sits still and plays dead.
